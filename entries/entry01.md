# Entry 1

While trying to figure out what topics to create an informative website about, many things came to mind. I thought of different areas of stem including engineering and technology. Engineering is very interesting for me and i would like to pursue engineering-based careers in the future. Technology is also very cool because it can be implemented almost anywhere to create more efficient and more useful things. In the end, I chose to more closely look into technology-based topics because they are so versatile.

Some of these topics that I looked into were Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Machine Learning especially stood out because its something I am interested in and would like to research. As well as this I thought of the future and how I can educate people about new and advanced technologies that will be implemented soon. I also thought of how my website could inspire people to pursue Machine Learning and AI-related careers.

In the near future, I hope to create subpages on my website about tech careers involving Machine Learning and AI-related careers. In the meantime, I will be seriously researching Machine Learning and AI to gather a deeper understanding of what it is and what it can become.
